# GPTron
GPTron is a messenger of GPT models from OpenAI. It connects users to the language models using a API key provided by the users.

## Usage
Simply double click the exe file in Windows OS. It will ask for an API key. I am attaching my key in the file api_key.txt and you can use it for a while. If it does not work in future (maybe I disactivate it due to high cost), you can get one from OpenAI. Enter the key and then you can start talking to OpenAI's GPT models.
