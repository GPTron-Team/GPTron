# GPTron
GPTron is a messenger of GPT models from OpenAI. It connects users to the language models using a API key provided by the users.

## Usage
Simply double click the exe file in Windows OS. It will ask for an API key. I am attaching my key in the file api key.txt and you can use it for a while. If it does not work in future (maybe I disactivate it due to high cost), you can get one from OpenAI. Enter the key and then you can start talking to OpenAI's GPT models.

## Web app
For a more convinient and more customized use of GPT or ChatGPT models, we are building a web app of GPTron at https://gogptron.com. Please keep watching on it.
